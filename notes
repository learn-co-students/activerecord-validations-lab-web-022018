All authors have a name
No two authors have the same name
Author phone numbers are exactly ten digits
All posts have a title
Post content is at least 250 characters long
Post summary is a maximum of 250 characters
Post category is either Fiction or Non-Fiction This step requires an inclusion validator,
which was not outlined in the README lesson. You'll need to refer to the Rails guide to look up how to use it.



Finally, add a custom validator to Post that ensures the title is sufficiently clickbait-y. If the title does not contain "Won't Believe", "Secret", "Top [number]", or "Guess", the validator should return false.

For future projects, it's a good idea to skim the list of available validation options. It will give you a sense of what's available and help with creating validations for your own model objects.
